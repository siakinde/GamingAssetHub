Introduction
------------

**GamingAssetHub** is a smart contract for a decentralized marketplace on the Stacks blockchain, designed to facilitate the secure and trustless trading of NFT-based gaming assets. It provides a robust framework for asset listings, direct sales, and a comprehensive auction system. The contract ensures secure ownership transfer and configurable marketplace fees, promoting a fair and transparent ecosystem for gamers and collectors.

Features
--------

-   **Secure Asset Listings**: Owners can list their gaming assets for a fixed price, with full control over the listing status.

-   **Direct Sales**: A secure mechanism for purchasing listed assets, handling payment transfer and ownership verification in a single transaction.

-   **Configurable Marketplace Fee**: The contract owner can adjust the marketplace fee, allowing for dynamic fee management. Fees are automatically deducted from sales and transferred to the contract owner.

-   **Comprehensive Auction System**:

    -   **Advanced Auctions**: Create auctions with a starting price, a defined duration, a reserve price, and an optional buyout price.

    -   **Bid Management**: The contract manages the highest bid and bidder, preventing bids below the current highest bid.

    -   **Automated Settlement**: The auction automatically settles upon completion, transferring the asset to the highest bidder and distributing the funds to the seller and marketplace.

-   **Ownership Verification**: All critical functions, such as updating a listing or creating an auction, include checks to ensure that only the asset's rightful owner can perform the action.

| `u101` | `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED` | The caller is not authorized to perform this action. |
| `u102` | `ERR-ASSET-NOT-FOUND` | The specified asset ID does not exist. |
| `u103` | `ERR-INVALID-PRICE` | The price or fee is invalid (e.g., zero or too high). |
| `u104` | `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS` | The caller has insufficient funds to complete the purchase. |
| `u105` | `ERR-ASSET-NOT-FOR-SALE` | The asset is not currently listed for direct sale. |

Data Structures
---------------

The contract uses two main maps and two data variables to store information about the assets, auctions, and marketplace configuration.

-   `asset-listings`: A map that stores the details of each gaming asset.

    -   `asset-id`: The unique identifier for the asset.

    -   `owner`: The principal (address) of the current owner.

    -   `price`: The fixed price for direct sale.

    -   `for-sale`: A boolean indicating if the asset is available for direct purchase.

    -   `game-title`: The name of the game the asset belongs to.

    -   `asset-type`: The category or type of the asset (e.g., "Weapon", "Skin").

-   `auctions`: A map that stores information about ongoing auctions.

    -   `asset-id`: The unique identifier for the auctioned asset.

    -   `seller`: The principal of the seller.

    -   `starting-price`: The initial price of the auction.

    -   `current-bid`: The current highest bid.

    -   `highest-bidder`: The principal of the highest bidder.

    -   `end-block`: The block height at which the auction ends.

    -   `active`: A boolean indicating if the auction is still active.

-   `marketplace-fee-percent`: A data variable storing the marketplace fee in basis points (e.g., `u250` for 2.5%).

-   `total-assets-listed`: A data variable tracking the total number of assets that have been listed on the marketplace.

* * * * *

Private Functions
-----------------

These functions are internal helpers used by the public functions to perform specific tasks. They cannot be called directly by an external user.

-   `calculate-fee (amount uint)`: Computes the marketplace fee based on a given amount and the `marketplace-fee-percent`.

-   `transfer-asset-ownership (asset-id uint) (from principal) (to principal)`: Updates the ownership of an asset in the `asset-listings` map.

-   `validate-asset-owner (asset-id uint) (caller principal)`: Checks if the caller of a function is the legitimate owner of the specified asset.

-   `finalize-auction-sale (asset-id uint) (buyer principal) (final-price uint)`: Handles the final steps of an auction, including transferring the asset to the buyer, distributing funds to the seller, and deleting the auction entry.
